                <p>Flag football is a variant of American football minus the physical contact and substituting tackles with two or three fabric flags.
                    Now the origin of Flag was during WWII, flag football was started for American soldiers serving in the war.Eventually, soldiers brought the idea of flag football to their homes and that's how it came to be.</p>
                    
                <p> In the NFL Flag website they say "In the 1990s, when the NFL launched a global health and wellness intiative called Play Football, they had one goal: to make football accessible for all children-no matter their age, size, or gender." And then that's how the NFL began their Flag program which helped grow the sport. An NFL Football Operations article says that " Flag football is one of the fastest-growing sports today, with more than 20 million participants in 100 countries and counting." </p>

                  <strong>About the creator</strong> Hello my name is Makenzie. I'm a Junior here at GBS and I'm also a member of the girls flagfootball team. I chose to research this topic because it has blown me away how fast the sport has grown. Here at Gbs in the 2023-2024 school year, our flag football team 
                  began as a club first since it wasn't an official sports in the IHSA. But in 2024 we were declared an official sport, but along with that, collages have even began starting their own flag football teams.
